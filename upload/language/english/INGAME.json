      "description": "Espionage probes are small, agile drones that provide data on fleets and planets. Fitted with specially designed engines, it allows them to cover vast distances in only a few minutes. Once in orbit around the target planet, they quickly collect data and transmit the report back via your Deep Space Network for evaluation. But there is a risk to the intelligent gathering aspect. During the time the report is transmitted back to your network, the signal can be detected by the target and the probes can be destroyed."

It was decided that a new ship was needed to break defenses to ensure maximum results. After years of research and development, the Bomber was created.<br><br>Using laser-guided targeting equipment and Plasma Bombs, the Bomber seeks out and destroys any defense mechanism it can find. As soon as the hyperspace drive is developed to Level 8, the Bomber is retrofitted with the hyperspace engine and can fly at higher speeds."

Scientists worked on the problem and discovered a method of transmitting electrical energy to the colony using specially designed satellites in geosynchronous orbit.<br><br> Solar Satellites gather solar energy and transmit it to a ground station using advanced laser technology. The efficiency of a solar satellite depends on the strength of the solar radiation it receives. In principle, energy production in orbits closer to the sun is greater than for planets in orbits distant from the sun. Since the satellites primary goal is the transmission of energy, they lack shielding and weapons capability, and because of this they are usually destroyed in large numbers in a major battle. However they do possess a small self-defense mechanism to defend itself in an espionage mission from an enemy empire if the mission is detected."

During operation, the Plasma turret first locks on a target and begins the process of firing. A plasma sphere is created in the turrets core by super heating and compressing gases, stripping them of their ions. Once the gas is superheated, compressed, and a plasma sphere is created, it is then loaded into the electromagnetic accelerator which is energized. Once fully energized, the accelerator is activated, which results in the plasma sphere being launched at an extremely high rate of speed to the intended target. From the targets perspective, the approaching bluish ball of plasma is impressive, but once it strikes, it causes instant destruction.<br><br> Defensive facilities deactivate as soon as they are too heavily damaged.

Advancements in shielding technology provided scientists with a way to develop a shield to protect an entire planet not only from space debris but, as it was learned, from an enemy attack. By creating a large electromagnetic field around the planet, space debris that would normally have destroyed the planet was deflected, and attacks from enemy Empires were thwarted. The first generators were large and the shield provided moderate protection, but it was later discovered that small shields did not afford the protection from larger scale attacks.

It can only be activated if nothing is being built (fleet, building, or defense), nothing is being researched, and none of your fleets are underway. Once it is activated, you are protected from new attacks. Attacks that have already started will be carried out. During vacation mode, production is set to zero and must be manually returned to 100 % after vacation mode ends. Vacation mode lasts a minimum of two days and can only be deactivated after this time.",
