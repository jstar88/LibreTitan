Coding standards
================

Files
-----

Files must be UTF-8 encoded and only contain Unix linebreaks (\n).

When a file ends with PHP code a PHP closing tag is not needed.


If/elseif/else/while/for/foreach
--------------------------------

Curly brackets are on their own lines and there are not spaces inside the
parenthesis.

    $var = true;

    if ($var)
    {
        ...
    }
    elseif (!$var)
    {
        ...
    }
    else
    {
        ...
    }

When the if/elseif/else only contains one statement the curly brackets are not
needed.

    if ($var)
        ...
    elseif (!$var)
        ...
    else
    {
        ...

The same rules are applied to while/for/foreach.


Funtions/Classes
----------------

Functions and classes also have the curly brackets on their own lines. Function
arguments with default values are done like it is done in the example code below.
Function names only consist of lowercase characters and underscores. Class names
are CamelCase and underscores are also allowed.

    function some_function($var, $var_2 = false)
    {
        ...
    }

    class SomeClass
    {
        public function some_function_in_a_class($var = 1)
        {
            ...
        }
    }


Variables
---------

Variable names only consist of lowercase characters and underscores.
